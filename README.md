# UI/UX Designer
I am a UI/UX Designer learning Front-End Development

### Background
Transitioning to UX/UI design, I bring project management and human-centered designs. I've led teams of 20, planned large-scale projects, and achieved successful outcomes in civil engineering and recently UX design. Skilled in analysis and implementation of design principles, I'm eager to create intuitive digital experiences. My background in civil engineering and teaching equips me to explain complex ideas, influence decisions, and execute design solutions.
